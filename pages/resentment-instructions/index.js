          In dealing with resentments, we put them on paper. We listed people,
          institutions, or principles with whom we were angry. Complete COLUMN 1
          from top to bottom. Do nothing with COLUMNS 2, 3, or 4 until COLUMN 1
          is complete.
        </li>
        <li>
          We asked ourselves why we were angry. Complete COLUMN 2 from top to
          bottom. Do nothing with COLUMNS 3 or 4 until COLUMN 2 is complete
        </li>
        <li>
          On our grudge list, we set opposite each name our injuries. Was it our
          self-esteem, our security, our ambitions, our personal or sex
          relations which had been terfered with? Complete COLUMN 3 from top to
          bottom, starting with self-esteem and ending with sexual ambitions
          column. Do nothing with COLUMN 4 until COLUMN 3 is complete.
        </li>
        <li>
          Referring to our list again, putting out of our minds the wrongs
          others had done, we resolutely looked at our own mistakes. Where had
          we been selfish, dishonest, self-seeking, frightened, or
          inconsiderate? Asking ourselves the above questions, we complete each
          column with COLUMN 4.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reading from the left, we now see the resentment (COLUMN1) the cause
          (COLUMN 2) the part of self that was affected (COLUMN 3) and the exact
          nature of the defect within us that allowed the resentment to surface
          and block us from our Higher Power's will (COLUMN 4).
